                I consulted Dr.Vivekananda Bheemisetty regarding multiple <br />injuries to my leg as the pain was not
                reducing. He was <br /> very patient with checking my reports and examining my <br /> injury, and he
                spent a good amount of time explaining the <br /> injury and suggesting a course of action. Not every
                doctor <br /> spends this amount of time on every single patient, which <br /> is great and keeps him on
                top when it comes to <br />interactions with patients. I would recommend this doctor<br /> without
                thinking twice. Overall, it's been a great experience.
